1) Do we need controllers at all? Why not handle them in a single callback?
2) DI for database and configuration? Black-hat testing could be easier.
3) Database populate script fro quick environment setup would be nice.
4) Docker and/or Vagrant for environment separation.
5) Add JWT based auth and rewrite everything in the user context
